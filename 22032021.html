    <div style="color: white;">With this diffeent style of scrolling through the website, it shows to your audience that you put effort in the website unlike some websites it could look rushed and effortless if 
        you use a a regular/default scrolling. personally, i think this way of scrolling is much better compared to the generic way, i think this scrolling (which is called "parallax scrolling effect") give my website 
        more elegance and effort. the parallax scrolling effect also kind of gives off a clean transition on the changes on differect images needed for the website, which i think is pretty cool. In this section 
        I will be adding information about the type of shoe it is and why they decided to create this for their brand. the information i will be putting here will be short, simple and straightforward. although iw ill be 
        making a page where they can know more inofrmation about the shoes and the information will be more in-depth.</div>
