                In this area I will be writing the quick and easy to read information about certain pairs of shoes. this website is for those whoare wanting to learn more about shoes, or is just starting to collect shoes, or for posers who just want to seem cool :/ lol but yea thats my website. 
                also why tf did it take me so long to figure out how to work the parallax scroll effect on this thing :/ lol thats embarassing. also i dont know what else to write to make this divider/section longer... so like im just gonna write the most random stuff... and i dont know what that random stuff is.
                well im currently listening to some really cool music lol! wait this actually looks really cool wth!! im so proud of myself lol, this took a lot longer than expected :/ but im so proud of myself lol. i feel like i say "lol" a lot like... stop, its like lowkey embarassing but like its fine... lol
                i feel like i say "lol" when i have nothing else to say, or like when im like uncomfy i just tpye "lol" or like when i write something mean or somewhat offensive, ill just write "lol" so they understand that its a "joke" or like just me saying not to take me seriously and like yea... lol.
                so anyways im just gonna put approx. 4 different pairs of shoes, which would be aj1, aj3, aj11 and maybe aj4 (idk yet lol ill think abt it) but yea thats my plan for this website, and ill ask multiple people what they think of this website, and if they have anychanges cause like, i need multiple 
                people to judge and tell me (HONESTLY) how they feel about this website :)

                <p>In this section i will aslo add some information about another pair of shoes that Air Jordan sells ( not sure yet lol), i will briefly explain why these shoes were created and how the design caame about to look like the way they do. also the main thing to do is to work on the navigation bar this week
                    cause like if u dont have a nav bar... u will fail :)

                <p>in the secton/division i will put brief information about another different pair of shoes, which was made by the Air Jordan company, there would be a button somewhere on the website that would give the viewers more in-depth information about that certain pair of shoes, and this button will take them 
                    somewhere where i will mention specific pairs of shoes. lol i also need to change i few headers cause like u cant see anyhting and like i dont even know what they say lol, so that need to be changed ASAP. also make the monster gun on the weekend cause u have enough. another reminder mufti day on 250321 so dont forget!
                cause that would be very embarassing if u forget and i will murder myself :) cause ive done enough embarassing stuff in my life already, i need a break :)</p>
